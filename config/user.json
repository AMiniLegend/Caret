/*

All settings for Caret are stored in JSON-formatted files. If you open one of
these files from the menu, then save it, it'll be dropped into Chrome's
synchronized storage, which means that (theoretically) all your computers will
get a copy. Comments are allowed, obviously--they'll be stripped out on load.

Unfortunately, it's not (yet) possible to merge configuration the way that
Sublime does, which means that this won't behave exactly like you may expect.
If new options are introduced, you'll need to copy your settings to a new
file, reset Caret's config to the defaults from the menu, then copy your
configuration changes back over. Sorry about that. I'm working on it.
