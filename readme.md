Caret
=====

Caret is a serious, graphical programmer's editor running as a Chrome Packaged App. Inspired by Sublime and built on top of the Ace editing component, it will offer:

* Tabbed multi-document editing
* Multiple selections with Sublime-like keystrokes
* Retained file handles (you can close and re-open it without disrupting your setup)
* Editor themes and syntax highlighting
* Smart Go To and Command Palette

It's not there yet, but we'll be there soon. The ultimate goal of Caret is to fill a gap that currently stymies web developers working on Chrome OS, offering a pleasant graphical editing environment without needing to run a second windowing system via Crouton.
